# Javascript-Bookmarklets
A collection of Javascript snippets to perform various tasks automatically.  

These snippets often won't work as javascript bookmarklets. For those ones you are suppposed to save it as a Snippet in Google Chrome. 
I'll add more detailed instructions (and maybe videos) demonstrating how to use them later on. 

For now here are the two Snippet sections and the two Snippets we have:

Canvas Snippets
1.) Assignment Status Changer 

What this does is it goes through all the submissions for an assignment and marks them as having no issues. 
I coded it to not change the status for assignments with a grade of 0 though. 
"Why would you want to do that?"

The problem I was facing was that Canvas group work and Zoom groups aren't flexible enough. 
So I would randomize my groups in Zoom and have one person from each group submit. 
This marked all the assignments for all the students who didnt submit as "Missing". 
So I wrote this code to go through and mark them all as "None", having no problems. 

Youtube Snippets
1.) Auto Video Playlist Transfer-er

What this does is it automatically transfers all the videos in a playlist to another playlist. 
This was necessary because Youtube made it impossible to make your liked videos playlist public. 
I wanted to share my favorite music videos with my family but was unable to make it public. 
So this script goes through a playlist and adds all the videos to a new playlist, one at at time.
It takes 8 seconds per video, so it can take a while, but it is a lot better than doing it manually.

It needs some improvements but it works for now. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to use it but don't know how.
